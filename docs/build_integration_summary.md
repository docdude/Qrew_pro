# Qrew macOS Universal Build Integration

## Summary

Your Qrew project now has two complementary approaches for building macOS universal binaries:

1. **Primary Method (Original Workflow):** Using separate native runners for each architecture
2. **Alternative Method (New Scripts):** Using Universal2 Python for cross-compilation

Both methods are valid and have their specific use cases. The GitHub workflow continues to use the primary method, and the new scripts provide an alternative when needed.

## Current GitHub Workflow

Your current GitHub workflow in `.github/workflows/build.yml` already implements the ideal approach:

1. Builds x86_64 version on macOS-13 (Intel)
2. Builds arm64 version on macOS-14 (Apple Silicon)
3. Creates universal binary in a separate job

This workflow is optimal for production builds because it uses native hardware for each architecture.

## New Universal2 Python Scripts

The new scripts we've created (`build_arm64_universal2.sh` and others) implement an alternative approach:

1. Use a Universal2 Python installation
2. Cross-compile arm64 binaries on Intel Macs
3. Combine with native Intel binaries using `create_universal.py`

This approach is useful for:
- Local development on Intel Macs
- Situations where Apple Silicon runners aren't available
- Troubleshooting architecture-specific issues

## Integration Recommendation

For your GitHub workflow, we recommend:

1. **Keep using your existing workflow** for production builds
2. **Add the new build_arm64_universal2.sh script** as a fallback option
3. **Update the workflow** to add workflow_dispatch trigger (already done)

This gives you flexibility without disrupting your existing build process.

## Testing Your Build Process

The `test_macos_build.sh` script helps verify that both approaches work correctly in your environment.

Run it locally to:
1. Test native architecture builds
2. Test cross-compilation (if on Intel Mac with Universal2 Python)
3. Test universal binary creation

## Documentation

Refer to these documents for more details:
- `docs/macos_build_recommendation.md` - Quick reference on when to use each approach
- `docs/universal_build_guide.md` - Detailed guide for universal builds
- `docs/github_workflow_guide.md` - How the GitHub workflow integrates with the scripts

## Next Steps

1. **Install Universal2 Python** on your development Mac if needed
2. **Test both approaches** using the test script
3. **Consider adding the arm64-crosscompile option** to your GitHub workflow as a fallback

The current solution gives you the best of both worlds: native builds for production and cross-compilation as a fallback when needed.
